# PK-WAP Deep Research Memo — Master Template with Guardrails

*(Instructions in parentheses are for the AI to follow and should **never** appear in the final memo.)*

---

### Introduction / Context

(State the case ID, PK-WAP analysis, and short description of the mathematical scenario. Include explicit attribution rules: unlabeled student turns that answer AI prompts are treated as student turns.)

---

## 1) Word counts & % student talk by page (estimated)

**IMPORTANT:** Table format **must match exactly**: `Page | Student Words | AI Words | % Student Talk`

* No extra columns unless explicitly requested.
* Column names must be exactly as shown.
* Percentages must be numeric (no `%` symbol).
* Provide a total % at the end.

| Page | Student Words | AI Words | % Student Talk |
| ---: | ------------: | -------: | -------------: |
|    … |             … |        … |              … |

**Overall student talk:** … words (**…**).

## 2) Layer Progression Map

(Use ASCII or a clear diagram to show PK layer sequence. Mark fold-backs with curved arrows and page refs. The style must be consistent across memos.)

---

## 3) Recursive / folding-back moments (narrative)

(Describe each major folding-back episode in paragraph form, with page refs, layer transitions, and how the student reconstructs understanding. Maintain consistent depth across memos.)

---

## 4) PK layer coding (evidence-rich)

(Table listing all 8 PK layers: Layer, Evidence from transcript, Notes on classification. Always include all 8 layers in order.)

| Layer             | Evidence from transcript | Notes on classification |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Primitive Knowing | …                        | …                       |
| Image-Making      | …                        | …                       |
| Image-Having      | …                        | …                       |
| Property-Noticing | …                        | …                       |
| Formalising       | …                        | …                       |
| Observing         | …                        | …                       |
| Structuring       | …                        | …                       |
| Inventising       | …                        | …                       |

## 5) Page-by-page PK-WAP coding

(Table for every page: Page, Dominant layer(s), Representative evidence, Notes. Must include all pages.)

| Page | Dominant layer(s) | Representative evidence | Notes |
| ---: | ----------------- | ----------------------- | ----- |
|    … | …                 | …                       | …     |

---

## 6) Representative quotes

(Subdivide into Student and AI. Include at least 4–6 quotes per side, with page numbers and conceptual significance. Format must remain consistent across memos.)

---

## 7) Missed opportunities (elaborated)

(List 3–5. Each must have 1–2 sentences explaining what was missed, where, and how it could have deepened learning.)

---

## 8) Summary of Findings

(1–2 paragraphs synthesizing engagement level, PK layer movement, tone, and key growth moments.)

---

## 9) Final observations

(One paragraph tying together PK movement, agency, tone, and possible improvements.)

---

## 10) Conclusion

(Short paragraph summing up why the case matters, with specific PK trajectory notation and final pedagogical implications.)

---

**Note:** All memos must maintain this structure, headings, and depth. Analytical content must be tailored to the specific transcript, but formatting and section presence are non-negotiable.
