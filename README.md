**Generative AI as a Recursive Learning Partner: A Pirie-Kieren Analysis of Taylor Series Instruction in University Calculus**

## Project Overview

This project examines how undergraduate calculus students engage in **recursive mathematical understanding** while learning Taylor series through collaboration with generative AI. The study applies the **Pirie-Kieren model of mathematical understanding** to analyze student-AI dialogue transcripts, revealing patterns of folding back and layer progression characteristic of deep mathematical learning.

### Key Innovation

The methodological innovation is the **Pirie-Kieren Work Analysis Protocol (PK-WAP)**, which uses GenAI as a systematic qualitative analysis partner. This approach enables consistent coding across large datasets while maintaining theoretical fidelity to the Pirie-Kieren framework.

## Study Design

### Two-Phase Analysis Pipeline

| Phase | Focus | Methods |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Phase I** | Quantitative Screening | Automated word count analysis; Student vs. AI talk percentages; High/low engagement case identification |
| **Phase II** | Qualitative Deep Analysis | PK-WAP coding via GenAI; Evidence-based layer identification; Recursive learning pattern detection |

### Participants

- **N=30+** student-AI dialogue transcripts
- University calculus students learning Taylor series
- Transcripts from AI tutoring interactions

## Theoretical Framework

### Pirie-Kieren Model of Mathematical Understanding

The Pirie-Kieren model describes mathematical understanding as a recursive, non-linear process through nested layers:

1. **Primitive Knowing** — Prior knowledge brought to the task
2. **Image Making** — Developing mental images through activities
3. **Image Having** — Using images without needing to reconstruct them
4. **Property Noticing** — Recognizing connections between images
5. **Formalising** — Abstracting common properties into formal definitions
6. **Observing** — Reflecting on formal understanding
7. **Structuring** — Connecting formal observations into theory
8. **Inventising** — Creating new questions and mathematical inquiry

### Key Constructs

- **Folding Back**: Returning to inner layers to extend or reconstruct understanding
- **Layer Progression**: Movement outward through increasingly sophisticated understanding
- **Don't Need Boundaries**: Points where prior constructions become embedded and automatic
