### Introduction / Context

This memo analyzes transcript P119-GX-S6 using the Pirie-Kieren Work Analysis Protocol (PK-WAP). The dialogue involves a student interacting with an AI to explore Taylor polynomial approximations in a real-world scenario. The student is guided through a structured activity, requiring them to conceptualize and apply Taylor series to a problem in video game physics. Unlabeled student turns that answer AI prompts are treated as student turns.

## 3) Recursive / folding-back moments (narrative)

A significant folding-back moment occurs on Page 03 when the student struggles to conceptualize the real-time physics problem in video games. Initially, they identify the problem but lack clarity on the function's complexity. The AI prompts them to sketch and consider the implications of precise calculations, leading the student to fold back from Property-Noticing to Image-Making. This recursive process helps the student refine their understanding of the problem's constraints and the role of Taylor approximations.

## 4) PK layer coding (evidence-rich)

| Layer             | Evidence from transcript | Notes on classification |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Primitive Knowing | Initial understanding of Taylor series | Basic awareness of Taylor series concept |
| Image-Making      | "video game physics" | Student begins to visualize the problem context |
| Image-Having      | "if it is too precise, the GPU and CPU can not calculate" | Student articulates a mental image of the problem |
| Property-Noticing | "4096 cape pieces x 60+ FPS = Millions of PDEs/second" | Student notices specific properties of the problem |
| Formalising       | "Taylor’s Saving Grace: Pencil time" | Student applies formal Taylor polynomial concepts |
| Observing         | …                        | No evidence of metacognitive reflection on the system |
| Structuring       | …                        | No evidence of connecting multiple formal observations |
| Inventising       | …                        | No evidence of posing new mathematical questions |
