## 3) Recursive / folding-back moments (narrative)

A significant folding-back occurs on Page 03 when the student initially attempts to describe the need for approximation in the drone scenario. The student reverts from an initial attempt at Formalising back to Property-Noticing, as they struggle to articulate why the exact function F(t) is unusable. With AI prompts, the student reconstructs their understanding by focusing on the chaotic nature of wind forces, eventually progressing back to Formalising with a clearer grasp of the approximation's necessity.

## 6) Representative quotes

**Student:**
1. "Imagine trying to keep a small drone hovering precisely under a bridge during a really windy storm." (Page 01)
2. "Wind is chaos, it doesn't stay constant!" (Page 02)
3. "Approximation needed right now" (Page 03)
4. "Include how fast the wind force is changing right now" (Page 04)
5. "Detect failure: The drone must constantly check if the force it feels matches the force the polynomial predicted." (Page 06)
6. "Real-world insight: Got it — perfect math isn't always the goal" (Page 09)

**AI:**
1. "What's a situation where calculating an exact answer might be impossible or impractical?" (Page 00)
2. "Your drone's wind force is a function F(t) —chaotic, full of tiny swirls and gusts." (Page 03)
3. "We'll approximate F(t) near a specific moment t using a Taylor polynomial." (Page 04)
4. "Your drone now uses F(t0) + F’(t0)(t-t0) to predict wind." (Page 05)
5. "Now—zoom out. You started with a drone's panic and ended with a philosophy of approximation." (Page 07)
6. "Mic drop. You've just graduated from ‘Taylor Polynomial Apprentice’ to ‘Approximation Sensei!’" (Page 09)

## 7) Missed opportunities (elaborated)

1. **Deeper Exploration of Chaos:** The AI could have prompted the student to explore the mathematical definition of chaos and its implications for approximation, deepening their understanding of why exact solutions are impractical.
   
2. **Connection to Real-World Applications:** The AI missed an opportunity to connect the student's learning to broader real-world applications of Taylor series, such as in engineering or physics, to enhance relevance.

3. **Encouraging Meta-Reflection:** The AI could have encouraged the student to reflect on their learning process more explicitly, fostering metacognitive skills and deeper conceptual understanding.

4. **Exploration of Higher-Order Terms:** The AI could have pushed the student to explore the implications of adding higher-order terms in the Taylor series, discussing the trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost.

5. **Discussion of Error Analysis:** The AI could have introduced the concept of error analysis in approximations, helping the student understand the limitations and potential errors in their calculations.
