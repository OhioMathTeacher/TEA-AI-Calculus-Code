# PK-WAP Deep Research Memo — Master Template with Guardrails

---

### Introduction / Context

This analysis pertains to transcript P78-G14-S4, where a student interacts with an AI tutor named Deepseek. The session focuses on understanding Taylor polynomials through a guided activity, where the AI adapts its teaching style based on a preliminary personality test. The student is tasked with creating a real-world scenario where a Taylor polynomial approximation is essential, exploring the function involved, and discussing the limitations of the approximation. The dialogue is analyzed using the Pirie-Kieren Work Analysis Protocol (PK-WAP) to trace the student's conceptual growth and identify recursive learning moments.

## 3) Recursive / folding-back moments (narrative)

A significant folding-back moment occurs on Page 7 when the student initially identifies the need for approximation due to the impracticality of computing exact values of \( e \). The AI prompts the student to reconsider the polynomial approximation, leading them to revisit their understanding of how polynomials can mimic complex functions. This recursive process helps the student solidify their grasp of Taylor polynomials by connecting the abstract concept to a tangible scenario.
