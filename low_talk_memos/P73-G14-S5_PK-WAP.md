### Introduction / Context

This analysis examines transcript P73-G14-S5, focusing on a student-AI dialogue where the student is guided through understanding Taylor polynomial approximations. The AI, adopting a personality-based teaching style, aims to help the student conceptualize the use of Taylor polynomials in real-world scenarios, specifically in pandemic modeling. Unlabeled student turns responding to AI prompts are treated as student turns.

## 2) Layer Progression Map

```
Primitive Knowing → Image-Making → Image-Having → Property-Noticing ↺ Image-Making → Property-Noticing → Formalising
```

---

## 3) Recursive / folding-back moments (narrative)

A significant folding-back moment occurs when the student struggles to conceptualize a real-world scenario for Taylor polynomial application. Initially, the student is at the Property-Noticing layer, recognizing the need for approximation in computationally limited contexts. However, they fold back to Image-Making as they require further guidance to visualize a specific scenario. The AI provides structured prompts, allowing the student to reconstruct their understanding and progress back to Property-Noticing with a clearer grasp of the problem context.

## 4) PK layer coding (evidence-rich)

| Layer             | Evidence from transcript | Notes on classification |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Primitive Knowing | Initial understanding of basic exponential growth | Recognizes exponential growth but lacks depth |
| Image-Making      | Attempts to visualize pandemic modeling scenario | Needs AI prompts to form a mental image |
| Image-Having      | Identifies exponential function in real-world context | Begins to hold a mental image of the scenario |
| Property-Noticing | Recognizes computational limits of e^t | Notices properties of exponential growth and computational constraints |
| Formalising       | Writes out Taylor series terms | Moves towards formal understanding of polynomial approximation |
| Observing         | No evidence observed | No metacognitive reflection on the system as a whole |
| Structuring       | No evidence observed | No connection of multiple formal observations into a theory |
| Inventising       | No evidence observed | No new mathematical questions or extensions posed |

## 7) Missed opportunities (elaborated)

1. **Deeper Metacognitive Reflection:** The AI could have prompted the student to reflect on the broader implications of using approximations in computational contexts, potentially reaching the Observing layer.
2. **Connecting to Other Mathematical Concepts:** Encouraging the student to relate Taylor polynomials to other areas of mathematics could have facilitated movement towards Structuring.
3. **Exploration of Real-World Applications:** The AI could have provided more examples of Taylor polynomial applications in various fields, enhancing the student's Image-Having and Property-Noticing layers.
4. **Encouraging Independent Scenario Creation:** By prompting the student to create their own scenarios, the AI could have fostered deeper engagement and creativity.
5. **Facilitating Peer Discussion:** Suggesting the student discuss their understanding with peers could have reinforced learning and provided new perspectives.

## 8) Summary of Findings

The dialogue demonstrates a progression from Primitive Knowing to Formalising, with significant folding-back moments that highlight the student's struggle to conceptualize and apply Taylor polynomials in a real-world context. The AI's structured guidance and prompts facilitate the student's movement through the PK layers, although opportunities for deeper metacognitive reflection and connection to broader mathematical concepts are missed. The tone is supportive and encouraging, fostering a positive learning environment.

## 9) Final observations

The student's journey through the PK layers reveals a developing understanding of Taylor polynomials, supported by the AI's adaptive teaching style. While the dialogue effectively guides the student through the initial layers, there is potential for deeper exploration and connection to other mathematical ideas. Encouraging independent scenario creation and peer discussion could enhance the student's agency and engagement.

## 10) Conclusion

This case illustrates the importance of structured guidance in facilitating conceptual growth within the PK framework. The student's trajectory from Primitive Knowing to Formalising highlights the role of AI in supporting mathematical understanding, while also underscoring the need for opportunities that promote metacognitive reflection and broader connections. The dialogue serves as a valuable example of how AI can scaffold learning, with implications for future educational research and practice.
