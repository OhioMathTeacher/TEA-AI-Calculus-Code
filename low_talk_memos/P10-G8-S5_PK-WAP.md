## 3) Recursive / folding-back moments (narrative)

A significant folding-back moment occurs on Page 4 when the student initially struggles to articulate why the exponential function is problematic for the processor. The AI prompts the student to reconsider the constraints of speed and hardware, leading the student to refine their understanding and articulate the issue more clearly. This moment illustrates a transition from Image-Making back to Image-Having, as the student reconstructs their understanding of the problem's constraints.

## 6) Representative quotes

**Student:**
1. "I think it is speed in nuclear medicine lab." (Page 4) - Identifying constraints.
2. "e is infinite, so the memory in computer can't restore all the number." (Page 4) - Articulating a problem.
3. "That is a guess, I believe we need to balance them correctly, that is to say, we need find a number both suitable for speed and accuracy, maybe 100?" (Page 5) - Attempting to balance factors.
4. "No calculator? Even better. We' Il estimate like pioneers—with pencil and rage." (Page 6) - Engaging with the problem creatively.

**AI:**
1. "Taylor polynomials emerged from Brook Taylor' s 1715 work, solving a precalculator problem." (Page 3) - Providing historical context.
2. "What part of ( N(t) = N_O et ) bogs down the chip?" (Page 4) - Prompting deeper analysis.
3. "Now substitute ( x = lambda t ) into your series. Write the first 4 terms." (Page 5) - Guiding formal mathematical work.
4. "Reflect: Why did we center the series at ( t= 0) and not ( t = 100 )? What breaks?" (Page 6) - Encouraging reflection on mathematical choices.

## 7) Missed opportunities (elaborated)

1. **Deeper Exploration of Historical Context:** The AI could have encouraged the student to explore more about the historical development of Taylor series, potentially deepening their appreciation for its applications.
   
2. **Encouraging Metacognition:** The AI missed opportunities to prompt the student to reflect on their learning process, which could have facilitated Observing-level metacognition.
   
3. **Connecting to Broader Mathematical Concepts:** The AI could have linked the Taylor series to other areas of calculus or real analysis, fostering a more integrated understanding.
   
4. **Facilitating Peer Discussion:** Suggesting the student discuss their scenario with peers might have encouraged collaborative learning and deeper insight.
   
5. **Exploring Alternative Approximations:** The AI could have prompted the student to consider other approximation methods, broadening their problem-solving toolkit.

## 8) Summary of Findings

The dialogue between the student and AI reveals a structured progression through the Pirie-Kieren layers, primarily reaching Formalising. The student demonstrates growth in understanding Taylor polynomials, moving from basic scenario creation to engaging with formal mathematical procedures. The AI's prompts effectively guide the student through the activity, though opportunities for deeper metacognitive engagement and broader mathematical connections were missed. The tone remains supportive yet challenging, aligning with the student's preference for direct, concise explanations.
