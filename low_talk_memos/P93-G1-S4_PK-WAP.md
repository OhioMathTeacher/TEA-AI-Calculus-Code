## 3) Recursive / folding-back moments (narrative)

A significant folding-back moment occurs on Page 3, where the student initially identifies the first term of the Taylor polynomial as 1, based on the function value at \( x = 0 \). The AI prompts the student to consider the derivatives, leading to a deeper understanding of how the polynomial approximates the function's curvature. This transition from Image-Having to Property-Noticing and back to Image-Making illustrates the student's reconstruction of understanding regarding the role of derivatives in shaping the polynomial.

## 9) Final observations

The PK movement in this transcript highlights the student's journey from basic understanding to formal application of Taylor polynomials. The AI's role as a facilitator rather than a provider of answers supports the student's agency and autonomy in learning. The contemplative tone and historical context enrich the learning experience, though opportunities for deeper exploration and modern connections were missed. Enhancing metacognitive reflection and peer interaction could further improve learning outcomes.
