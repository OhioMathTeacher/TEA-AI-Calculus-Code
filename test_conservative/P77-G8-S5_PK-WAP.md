### Introduction / Context

Case ID: P77-G8-S5. This PK-WAP analysis examines a student-AI dialogue focused on understanding Taylor polynomial approximations in a real-world context. The student is guided through a structured activity involving the creation of a scenario where a Taylor polynomial is the only practical solution. The AI adopts a humorous and supportive teaching persona, encouraging the student to explore and articulate their understanding without providing direct answers. Unlabeled student turns that respond to AI prompts are treated as student turns.

## 3) Recursive / folding-back moments (narrative)

The student initially engages in Image-Making by brainstorming a real-world problem involving a frisbee's trajectory (Page 2). As they attempt to articulate the complexity of the problem, they fold back to Image-Making, refining their understanding of the forces at play and the impracticality of an exact solution. This folding-back is evident when the student revisits the problem's complexity and attempts to simplify it using a Taylor polynomial (Page 3). The student then progresses to Property-Noticing as they identify specific challenges in modeling the problem and the limitations of their approximation (Page 4). Another folding-back occurs when the student revisits their approximation to consider its accuracy and limitations, demonstrating a deeper understanding of the Taylor series' role in approximating complex functions (Page 5).

## 6) Representative quotes

**Student:**

4. "Taylor series aren't just formulas; they're useful for real-world approximations, though with limits." (Page 5)
5. "Errors will pile up fast! Using past endpoints as new starts makes tiny errors snowball." (Page 7)

**AI:**

1. "Ohhh, a frisbee in the wind? That’s not just a headache—that’s calculus on hard mode." (Page 2)
2. "Boom. You just summarized why physicists sometimes cry into their coffee." (Page 3)
3. "Look at you, casually dropping Taylor expansions like it’s no big deal." (Page 4)
4. "Taylor polynomials are like duct tape: great for quick fixes, but don’t build a bridge with them." (Page 5)
5. "OHHHH, LOOK WHO JUST INVENTED PIECEWISE TAYLOR APPROXIMATION LIKE SOME KIND OF MATH ROCKSTAR." (Page 6)
